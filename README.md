USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!
Wrongfully extracted items can not be recovered!

In case you want to compile it yourself into an .exe file:

-Install Python on your system: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-on-windows/

-Convert a Python Script to an executable file: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-python-script-to-exe-file/



General Info:

Open the application as administrator (important, otherwise it cannot access the cabal window) ->

Open your inventory with an empty page (top left and bottom right slot needs to be empty) ->

Place the application window at a position that it doesnt block those two inventory slots ->

Click on "Select Inventory Size" and click into the center of the top left inventory slot and then into the center of the bottom right slot ->

It will now create a file saving these positions, so if your cabal window is at the same position you dont need to set these positions again ->

Now you need to chose an extract key which will trigger the extraction. Currently only Keyboard buttons are allowed! ->

When every prior steps are done you can click "Enable Extraction" and the application will wait for your keypress of the selected key

Now if you want to extract a page of items, just start the "item extraction mode" in your inventory and then click the assigned button and it will select all items on this page you are currently on.
